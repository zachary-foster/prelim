## Is the microbiome heritable?

1) Culture random members of the seed microbiome
2) Insert plasmids with a custom oligo 
3) Innoculate steril(?) seed and grow plants through 2 generations.
4) Use qPCR to test for the presence of the oligo in the seed of the 2nd generation.


## Does host phylogeny correlate with seed microbiome?

Can be tested by making a distance matrix of phylogenetic distance and a matrix of communiity dissimilarity and correlating the two using a Procrustes test or mantel test.

Envriromental conditions or seed morphology could be accounted for with a partial mantel test perhpas

The realtive improtance of envrioment and host phylogeny could be assessed using a PERMANOVA of PCA coordinaes. 

## Is the seed microbiom adaptive?


## Can the microbiome be controlled by host genotype?
